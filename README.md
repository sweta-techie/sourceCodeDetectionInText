#Source Code Detection Using Enhanced Regex Patterns and Heuristics
Description:
This project focuses on developing a robust system for detecting source code snippets within text data. The system utilizes enhanced regular expression (regex) patterns and various heuristics to accurately identify code written in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and C#.

The project integrates a machine learning pipeline that leverages these regex-based rules alongside Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text segments as either source code or non-source code. The solution is designed to handle complex and diverse environments, making it applicable in scenarios like document processing, code plagiarism detection, and automated code extraction from mixed-content files.

Key Features:
Enhanced Regex Patterns: Utilizes detailed regex patterns specifically designed for JavaScript, C#, and other programming languages to improve the detection accuracy of source code.

Heuristics-Based Detection: Implements additional heuristics such as detecting semi-colons at the end of lines, parentheses, and camelCase identifiers, which are common in programming languages.

Threshold-Based Classification: Sets a minimum threshold for the number of regex pattern matches required to classify a text segment as source code, ensuring higher accuracy and reducing false positives.

Machine Learning Integration: Combines regex and heuristics with machine learning techniques to refine the detection process and improve classification performance.

Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale text data efficiently, making it suitable for integration into larger systems and applications.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for developing the detection algorithms and machine learning models.
Regular Expressions (Regex): For pattern matching specific to different programming languages.
NLP: Utilized for processing and analyzing textual data to distinguish between source code and non-source code segments.
Machine Learning: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models are used for refining classification accuracy.
Streamlit: Optional, for creating a simple user interface to interact with the detection tool.
